 # Diamond Pattern in Java

This code prints a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) using Java. The pattern consists of two parts: an upper part and a lower part. The upper part is made of n rows, where n is the size of the pattern. Each row in the upper part has n-i spaces, where i is the row number, followed by 2*i-1 asterisks. The lower part is also made of n rows, but in reverse order. Each row in the lower part has n-i spaces, where i is the row number, followed by 2*i-1 asterisks.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Importing the Scanner Class

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console.

### 2. Defining the `main` Method

```java
public class DiamondPattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It is called when the program is executed.

### 3. Declaring Variables

```java
int n; // size of the pattern
```

This line declares an integer variable `n` to store the size of the pattern. The size of the pattern is the number of rows and columns in the diamond.

### 4. Reading the Size of the Pattern from the Console

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter the size of the pattern:");
n = scanner.nextInt();
```

These lines read the size of the pattern from the console using the `Scanner` class. The user is prompted to enter the size of the pattern, and the entered value is stored in the variable `n`.

### 5. Printing the Upper Part of the Diamond

```java
// upper part
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    // spaces
    for (int j = 1; j <= n - i; j++) {
        System.out.print(" ");
    }
    // asterisks
    for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * i - 1; j++) {
        System.out.print("*");
    }
