 # Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.

## Implementation

The Java code provided implements the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion. The `towerOfHanoi` method takes three parameters:

* `n`: The number of disks.
* `source`: The rod from which the disks are to be moved.
* `destination`: The rod to which the disks are to be moved.
* `auxiliary`: The rod that is used as an auxiliary rod.

The method first checks if there is only one disk. If so, it simply prints the instruction to move the disk from the source rod to the destination rod.

If there are more than one disk, the method recursively calls itself twice. The first call moves the top n-1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod. The second call moves the remaining disk from the source rod to the destination rod. The third call moves the n-1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `main` method creates two instances of the `towerOfHanoi` class, one with 3 disks and one with 4 disks.
2. The `towerOfHanoi` method is called with the following parameters:
    * `n`: The number of disks.
    * `source`: The rod from which the disks are to be moved.
    * `destination`: The rod to which the disks are to be moved.
    * `auxiliary`: The rod that is used as an auxiliary rod.
