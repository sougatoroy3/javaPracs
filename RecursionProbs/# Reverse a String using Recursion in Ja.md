 # Reverse a String using Recursion in Java

This Java program demonstrates how to reverse a string using a recursive method. The `reverse2` method takes two parameters: the string to be reversed and the index of the last character in the string. The method uses recursion to print the characters of the string in reverse order.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The `reverse2` method is defined with two parameters: `str` (the string to be reversed) and `idx` (the index of the last character in the string).

2. The method first checks if `idx` is equal to 0. If it is, then the method prints the character at index 0 and returns. This is the base case of the recursion.

3. If `idx` is not equal to 0, then the method prints the character at index `idx` and calls itself recursively with the arguments `str` and `idx-1`. This step is repeated until `idx` reaches 0, at which point the recursion stops and the reversed string is printed.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the `reverse2` method to reverse the string "Hello World".

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputStr = "Hello World";
        System.out.print("Input String is: ");
        System.out.println(inputStr);
        int len = inputStr.length();
        System.out.print("Reversed String is: ");
        reverse2(inputStr, len-1);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Input String is: Hello World
Reversed String is: dlroW olleH
```

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates how to reverse a string using a recursive method. The method uses a simple recursive algorithm to print the characters of the string in reverse order.
