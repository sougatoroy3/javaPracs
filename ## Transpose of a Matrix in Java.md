 # Transpose of a Matrix in Java

This Java program calculates and prints the transpose of a given matrix. A transpose of a matrix is a new matrix that is formed by switching the rows and columns of the original matrix.

## Understanding the Code

### 1. Importing Necessary Packages

```java
import java.util.*;
```

This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to read input from the console.

### 2. Defining the `main` Method

```java
public class transposeOfAMatrix {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
```

This is the entry point of the program. The `main` method is where the execution of the program begins.

### 3. Reading the Dimensions of the Matrix

```java
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      int m = sc.nextInt();
```

These lines read the number of rows (`n`) and columns (`m`) of the matrix from the console using the `Scanner` object `sc`.

### 4. Declaring the Matrix

```java
      int matrix[][] = new int[n][m];
```

This line declares a two-dimensional array called `matrix` with `n` rows and `m` columns to store the elements of the matrix.

### 5. Reading the Matrix Elements

```java
      for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
           for(int j=0; j<m; j++) {
               matrix[i][j] = sc.nextInt();
           }
      }
```

These nested loops read the elements of the matrix from the console and store them in the `matrix` array.

### 6. Printing the Transpose

```java
      System.out.println("The transpose is : ");
      //To print transpose
      for(int j=0; j<m ;j++) {
          for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
              System.out.print(matrix[i][j]+" ");
          }
          System.out.println();
      }
```

These nested loops print the transpose of the matrix. The outer loop iterates through the columns of the original matrix, and the inner loop iterates through the rows of the original matrix. The elements are printed in the transposed order.
