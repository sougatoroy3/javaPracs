 # Butterfly Java Program

This Java program generates an ASCII art representation of a butterfly. The program first prompts the user to enter the number of lines they want the butterfly to have. The number of lines determines the size of the butterfly.

The program then uses two nested `for` loops to create the upper half of the butterfly. The outer `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of lines entered by the user. The inner `for` loop iterates from 1 to `i`, where `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop.

Inside the inner `for` loop, the program prints an asterisk (`*`) character. This creates a row of asterisks that represents the body of the butterfly.

After printing the row of asterisks, the program prints a series of spaces. The number of spaces is determined by the formula `2 * (n-i)`. This formula calculates the number of spaces needed to center the butterfly on the screen.

After printing the spaces, the program prints another row of asterisks. This creates the other side of the butterfly's body.

The program then moves on to the next iteration of the outer `for` loop. This process is repeated until the upper half of the butterfly is complete.

The program then uses two nested `for` loops to create the lower half of the butterfly. The outer `for` loop iterates from `n` to 1, where `n` is the number of lines entered by the user. The inner `for` loop iterates from 1 to `i`, where `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop.

Inside the inner `for` loop, the program prints an asterisk (`*`) character. This creates a row of asterisks that represents the body of the butterfly.

After printing the row of asterisks, the program prints a series of spaces. The number of spaces is determined by the formula `2 * (n-i)`. This formula calculates the number of spaces needed to center the butterfly on the screen.

After printing the spaces, the program prints another row of asterisks. This creates the other side of the butterfly's body.

The program then moves on to the next iteration of the outer `for` loop. This process is repeated until the lower half of the butterfly is complete.

The final output of the program is an ASCII art representation of a butterfly. The size of the butterfly is
