 **Box Outline**

This code draws a box outline using `for` loops and `if` statements.

**Implementation Details**

The code first prints the message "Box Outline:" to the console.

Then, it uses two nested `for` loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the box. The outer loop (controlled by the variable `i`) iterates over the rows, and the inner loop (controlled by the variable `j`) iterates over the columns.

Inside the inner loop, there is an `if` statement that checks whether the current row or column is the first or last row or column. If it is, the `if` statement prints an asterisk (*). Otherwise, it prints a space.

This creates a box outline with asterisks on the top, bottom, left, and right sides, and spaces in the middle.

**Example Output**

The following is an example of the output of the code:

```
Box Outline:
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
2. The `for` loop controlled by the variable `i` iterates over the rows of the box.
3. The `for` loop controlled by the variable `j` iterates over the columns of the box.
4. The `if` statement checks whether the current row or column is the first or last row or column.
5. If the current row or column is the first or last row or column, the `if` statement prints an asterisk (*).
6. Otherwise, the `if` statement prints a space.
7. The `System.out.println()` statement prints a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line.
8. The program repeats steps 2-7 until it has drawn the entire box outline.

**Conclusion**

This code is a simple example of how to use `for` loops and `if` statements to draw a box outline. It is a good starting point for learning how to draw more complex shapes using code.
