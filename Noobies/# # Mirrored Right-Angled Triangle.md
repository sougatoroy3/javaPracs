 **Mirrored Right-Angled Triangle in Java**

This Java program generates a mirrored right-angled triangle of a specified height. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

**1. Importing the Scanner Class:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which allows us to read input from the console.

**2. Main Method:**

```java
public class mirroredRightAngledTriangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
```

- The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
- We create a `Scanner` object named `sc` to read input from the console.
- We declare an integer variable `n` to store the height of the triangle.
- We use the `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` object to read the value of `n` from the console.

**3. Outer Loop for Rows:**

```java
//outer loop for rows
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
```

- This `for` loop controls the number of rows in the triangle.
- It starts from `i = 1` and runs until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

**4. Inner Loop for Columns (Spaces):**

```java
//inner loop for columns, printing spaces
for (int j = 1; j <= n - i; j++) System.out.print(" ");
```

- This nested `for` loop controls the number of spaces in each row.
- It starts from `j = 1` and runs until `j` is less than or equal to `n - i`.
- This loop prints spaces to create the mirrored effect of the triangle.

**5. Inner Loop for Columns (Stars):**

```java
for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) System.out.print("*");
```

- This nested `for` loop controls the number of stars in each row.
- It starts from `j = 1` and runs until `j` is less than or equal to `i`.
- This loop prints stars to create the right-angled triangle.
