 ## Insertion Sort Algorithm in Java

This repository contains an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in Java. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building up the sorted list one element at a time. It is relatively efficient for small data sets, but it is not as efficient as other sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or merge sort, for larger data sets.

### Code Explanation

The code is written in Java and consists of two classes: `insertionSort` and `Main`. The `insertionSort` class contains a single method, `printArray`, which is used to print the elements of an array to the console. The `Main` class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

The main method creates an array of integers and then calls the `insertionSort` method to sort the array. The `insertionSort` method works by iterating over the array, starting at the second element, and comparing each element to the elements that come before it. If an element is smaller than the element before it, the two elements are swapped. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

The following code snippet shows the implementation of the `insertionSort` method:

```java
public static void insertionSort(int arr[]) {
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int current = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > current) {
            // Keep swapping
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = current;
    }
}
```

The `insertionSort` method takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order. The method works by iterating over the array, starting at the second element, and comparing each element to the elements that come before it. If an element is smaller than the element before it, the two elements are swapped. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

The following code snippet shows how the `insertionSort` method is called in the `Main` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = {7, 8, 1, 3, 2};

    // Insertion sort
    insertionSort(arr);

    // Print the sorted array
