 ### stringus.java

This Java program demonstrates the concept of string equality and the importance of using the correct comparison operator. It includes three `if` statements that compare two strings using different comparison operators: `equals()`, `==`, and `new String()`.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **String Declaration**:
   ```java
   String name1 = "Tony";
   String name2 = "Tony";
   ```
   Here, we declare two string variables, `name1` and `name2`, and assign them the same value, "Tony".

2. **String Comparison with `equals()`**:
   ```java
   if(name1.equals(name2)) {
       System.out.println("They are the same string");
   } else {
       System.out.println("They are different strings");
   }
   ```
   In this `if` statement, we use the `equals()` method to compare the two strings. The `equals()` method compares the content of the strings and returns `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise. In this case, since both strings have the same content, the output will be:
   ```
   They are the same string
   ```

3. **String Comparison with `==`**:
   ```java
   if(name1 == name2) {
       System.out.println("They are the same string");
   } else {
       System.out.println("They are different strings");
   }
   ```
   In this `if` statement, we use the `==` operator to compare the two strings. The `==` operator compares the references of the strings, not their content. In this case, since both `name1` and `name2` refer to the same string object in memory, the output will be:
   ```
   They are the same string
   ```

4. **String Comparison with `new String()`**:
   ```java
   if(new String("Tony") == new String("Tony")) {
       System.out.println("They are the same string");
   } else {
       System.out.println("They are different strings");
   }
   ```
   In this `if` statement, we create two new string objects using the `new String()` constructor and compare them using the `==` operator. Since
