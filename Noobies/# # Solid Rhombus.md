 **Solid Rhombus Java Program**

This Java program prints a solid rhombus pattern of stars. The rhombus is formed by printing a series of lines, each with a different number of spaces and stars. The number of spaces decreases from the top to the middle of the rhombus, and then increases again from the middle to the bottom. The number of stars increases from the top to the middle of the rhombus, and then decreases again from the middle to the bottom.

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

1. **Import the Scanner class.**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

The Scanner class is used to read input from the user. In this program, we will use the Scanner class to read the size of the rhombus from the user.

2. **Define the main method.**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```

The main method is the entry point of the program. This is where the program execution begins.

3. **Create a Scanner object.**

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

The Scanner object is used to read input from the user.

4. **Read the size of the rhombus from the user.**

```java
int n = sc.nextInt();
```

The nextInt() method reads an integer from the user. In this case, we are reading the size of the rhombus from the user.

5. **Print the rhombus pattern.**

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    // Spaces
    for (int j = 1; j <= n - i; j++) {
        System.out.print(" ");
    }

    // Stars
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        System.out.print("*");
    }

    System.out.println();
}
```

This code prints the rhombus pattern. The outer loop (controlled by the variable i) iterates over the rows of the rhombus. The inner loop (controlled by the variable j) iterates over the columns of the rhombus.

For each row, the code first prints a number of spaces equal to the difference between the size of the rhombus and the current row number. This creates the slanted sides of the rhombus.

Next, the code prints a number of
